This project is about people start charing there feelings. The feelings go into the bottles in the air ready to be read by other people. 
There is also a twitterfeed showing how people feel and a map that could be a potential project to have real bottles that people can find by treasurehunting.
There is also Tetris as a suprise.
ItÂ´s all in swedish since targetted towards swedes and stockholmers.
